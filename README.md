# Image classification of osteoperosis using chest xray

## Project Description

### Problem Statement

The goal is to develop an early detection tool for osteoperosis:

1. Pretrain model using unsupervised learning methods like Auto maskedencoder 
2. Classification of 3 labels being normal, osteopenia and osteoperosis

<br>

### Scope
- Develop a Comprehensive Machine Learning Pipeline: This includes handling various stages such as Data Processing, Model Training, Evaluation, and Inference. 
- Visualization Tool: Implement a tool for users to view the results of the model's inferences and to access the retraining pipeline. This tool should allow for intuitive interaction and clear presentation of the data.

## App Setup

To set up a Python virtual environment, follow these steps. This environment will help you manage the project's dependencies separately from your global Python setup.

1. **Create the Virtual Environment:**

   Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new virtual environment named `env`:

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   ```

2. **Activate environment:**

    ```bash
    .\env\Scripts\activate
    ```   

3. **Install Required packages**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
